  Here's how it works:

  1. In your CMakeLists.txt (line 36):
  find_package(CGAL CONFIG REQUIRED)
  2. CGAL depends on GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) for exact arithmetic computations.
  3. vcpkg's dependency chain:
    - You install CGAL via vcpkg (through your vcpkg.json manifest)
    - vcpkg automatically installs GMP as a transitive dependency of CGAL
    - The gmp-10.dll gets built and placed in your library/x64-windows/bin/ folder
  4. When you link CGAL:
  target_link_libraries(qmat_cli PRIVATE
      CGAL::CGAL
      ...
  )
  4. This automatically links against GMP through CGAL's CMake config files.

  To see CGAL's dependencies, you can check:
  - library/x64-windows/share/cgal/CGALConfig.cmake
  - Or run: vcpkg depend-info cgal

  The DLL needs to be in the same directory as your executable (or in PATH) at runtime. If you need to copy it
  automatically during build, you could add a post-build step to CMakeLists.txt.
